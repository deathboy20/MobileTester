/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for MobileTester application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model where users can only access and modify their own data.
 * The rules also ensure that jobs are associated with the user who created them, enabling secure access and management.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with `userId` matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /jobs/{jobId}: Stores test job data, including a `userId` field indicating the job's owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user documents.
 * - Jobs are owned by the user who created them, and only the owner can modify them.
 * - Denormalization is used to store the `userId` within the job document, avoiding costly `get()` calls for authorization.
 * - Data shape validation is relaxed for prototyping, focusing on ownership and relational integrity.
